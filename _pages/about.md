I am a final year PhD Student at the Australian National University. My PhD work spans both the theoretical foundations and practical applications of modern graph matching, exploring how concepts from stable matching and optimal transport theory can be leveraged to develop novel learning frameworks for graph matching. Prior to starting my PhD, I worked as a Research and Development Engineer, delivering solutions in factory schedule optimization and edge computing. I completed my BSc(Hons) degree in Computer Science and Engineering from University of Moratuwa, Sri Lanka. I am a huge fan of cricket and loves to swim in my leisure time.
